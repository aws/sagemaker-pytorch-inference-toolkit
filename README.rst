===================================
SageMaker PyTorch Inference Toolkit
===================================

SageMaker PyTorch Inference Toolkit is an open-source library for serving PyTorch models on Amazon SageMaker.
This library provides default pre-processing, predict and postprocessing for certain PyTorch model types and
is responsible for starting up the TorchServe model server on SageMaker, which is responsible for handling inference requests.

For training, see `SageMaker PyTorch Training Toolkit <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-training-toolkit>`__.
